  - No longer move parameters starting with oauth_ to the Authorization header
    from the query or body parameters; the only modification to the request is
    to add the Authorization header itself, as per the spec. Custom oauth_
    parameters should be passed directly to the authenticate method rather than
    in query or body parameters, so they can be properly sent in the header.
  - Remove the remove_query_params and remove_body_params methods from the
    WWW::OAuth::Request role as they are no longer needed.
